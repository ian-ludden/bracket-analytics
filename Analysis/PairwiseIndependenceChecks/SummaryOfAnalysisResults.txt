Chi-Square Goodness-Of-Fit Test for Bracket Distributions
Across Final Four Patterns (Comparing to Uniform Distribution):

[000, 001, ... , 111] frequencies are:
[8, 6, 2, 4, 5, 3, 3, 2]

X^2: 7.485

P-value: 0.38 (computed using 7 DF; not statistically significant)

Takeaway: The distribution of brackets by final four pattern appears
uniform.

With alpha = 0.10, this is statistically significant, so the regional 
championship game is dependent on the outcomes of the regional semifinal
games (unsurprisingly). However, with alpha = 0.05, this is NOT 
statistically significant. 

Takeaway: Whether the favorite wins in the regional final may depend on
whether the favorite wins in each of the regional semifinal games.

Chi-Square Test of Independence between two positions in region vectors:

FFF: Game 1 (left) vs. Game 8 (top)
      |  0  |  1  || Total
--------------------------
   0  | 5   | 60  || 65 
--------------------------
   1  | 13  | 54  || 67 
--------------------------
--------------------------
Total | 18  | 114 || 132

c^2: 3.8419 > 3.841 is significant with alpha = 0.05
(according to table at 
http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda3674.htm )

Takeaway: If the 8 seed beats the 9 seed, it significantly affects
the probability that the 1 seed wins its second-round game.

Takeaway: For both representations, the outcome of the second-round game
between 3/14 and 6/11 depends on the outcome of the 3/14 game (but it did
not seem to depend on the outcome of the 6/11 game).

of the 2/15 vs. 7/10 game appears to depend on the outcome of 
the 2/15 game. This is unsurprising.
