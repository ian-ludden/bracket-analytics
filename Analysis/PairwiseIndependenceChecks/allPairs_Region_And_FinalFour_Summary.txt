Summary of Pairwise Independence Test Results
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Many of the detected "dependencies" in the test were irrelevant, as
they were between games that could not possibly affect one another. 
For example, the 4 vs. 13 game in the first region (bit 3) and the 
6/11 vs. 3/14 game in the first region (bit 10) had a chi-square 
value of 4.3421, which meets the 3.841 cutoff for significance.

However, the following relationships look meaningful (test suggests
dependence, and 2nd game follows 1st in bracket):

Region 1
3, 9
3, 14
5, 10
8, 12
9, 12
9, 14
11, 13

Region 2
18, 24
20, 25
22, 26
25, 29
26, 28

Region 3
34, 44
