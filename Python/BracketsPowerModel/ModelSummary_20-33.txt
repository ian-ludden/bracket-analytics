Expand computational section, report all models we tried.
- Explain finite number of adjustments, and explain how we combined them in the different models. 

Add to slides: what it takes to be able to report some of the power model results (the ones that produced good results).

Alternative test when 0 in a conting. table?

Perhaps generate 1-seed and 2-seed paths as single entity

Same analyses, pooled across regions
